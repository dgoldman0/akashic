# akashic-audio-pcm — PCM Audio Buffer Abstraction for KDOS / Megapad-64

Flat interleaved PCM audio buffer with arbitrary sample rates, bit
depths, and channel counts.  Every audio source — earcons, voice,
music, synthesis output, streaming — is a PCM buffer.  Analogous to
`surface.f` for pixels.

```forth
REQUIRE audio/pcm.f
```

`PROVIDED akashic-audio-pcm` — safe to include multiple times.
No unconditional dependencies (guarded builds load the shared guard module).

## Design Principles

| Principle | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Interleaved storage** | Samples are interleaved: `[L0 R0] [L1 R1] ...`. One "frame" = one sample per channel. |
| **Multi-format** | 8-bit unsigned, 16-bit signed, 32-bit signed.  Sample rates 8000–96000 Hz. |
| **System allocation** | Descriptor and sample data use `ALLOCATE`; KDOS may route suitable allocations through XMEM. Allocation failure is reported before a partial descriptor escapes. |
| **Ownership model** | `PCM-ALLOC` owns its data (freed on `PCM-FREE`). `PCM-CREATE-FROM` and `PCM-SLICE` wrap external data (no free). |
| **Variable-based state** | Internal scratch uses `VARIABLE`s — not re-entrant. |
| **Prefix convention** | Public: `PCM-`. Internal: `_PCM-`. Field accessors: `P.xxx`. |

## Memory Layout

A PCM descriptor occupies 10 cells = 80 bytes:

```
Offset  Size   Field
──────  ─────  ──────────────
+0      8      data       — pointer to interleaved sample data
+8      8      len        — number of frames
+16     8      rate       — sample rate in Hz
+24     8      bits       — bits per sample (8, 16, or 32)
+32     8      channels   — channel count (1 = mono, 2 = stereo, ...)
+40     8      flags      — bit 0: owns buffer; bit 1 is retained for legacy direct-XMEM descriptors
+48     8      offset     — read/write cursor (frame index)
+56     8      peak       — peak absolute sample value seen
+64     8      user       — application-defined payload
+72     8      (reserved)
```

Field accessor words (`P.DATA`, `P.LEN`, ...) return the address of
each field for use with `@` and `!`.

### Sample Data Layout

Samples are stored contiguously in interleaved order.  The byte size
of one frame is `(bits / 8) × channels`.

**Mono (1 channel):**
```
[s0] [s1] [s2] [s3] ...
```

**Stereo (2 channels):**
```
[L0 R0] [L1 R1] [L2 R2] ...
```

Total data size in bytes = `frames × (bits / 8) × channels`.

## Creation & Destruction

### PCM-ALLOC

```forth
PCM-ALLOC  ( frames rate bits chans -- buf )
```

Allocate a new PCM buffer.  Sample data is zeroed (silence).
Uses the KDOS system allocator for both objects. Invalid dimensions or bit
depth ABORT before allocation.  Allocator failures THROW the allocator's
nonzero `ior`, allowing a surrounding `CATCH` to recover; if sample-data
allocation fails, the descriptor is released before that THROW. Frame,
sample-width, and channel products are checked before multiplication, so a
wrapped size cannot underallocate. The final data size also reserves KDOS's
worst-case alignment and XMEM-prefix overhead before calling `ALLOCATE`, so
allocator rounding cannot wrap a near-cell-limit request into a tiny block.

```forth
44100 44100 16 2 PCM-ALLOC CONSTANT one-sec-stereo
1024 8000 8 1 PCM-ALLOC CONSTANT short-mono
```

### PCM-ALLOC-MS

```forth
PCM-ALLOC-MS  ( ms rate bits chans -- buf )
```

Allocate by duration in milliseconds.  Computes the frame count
as `ms × rate / 1000`, then delegates to `PCM-ALLOC`. Duration and rate
must be positive, their product is checked for cell overflow, and a duration
shorter than one frame is rejected.

```forth
500 44100 16 2 PCM-ALLOC-MS CONSTANT half-sec
\ → 22050 frames at 44100 Hz, 16-bit stereo
```

### PCM-CREATE-FROM

```forth
PCM-CREATE-FROM  ( addr frames rate bits chans -- buf )
```

Wrap an existing sample buffer in a PCM descriptor.  The buffer
does **not** own the data — `PCM-FREE` will not free it.  Use for
hardware DMA buffers, shared memory regions, or aliasing into
larger buffers.

The address must be non-zero, frames must be non-negative, rate and channels
must be positive, and bits must be 8, 16, or 32.  The described byte extent is
checked for cell overflow even though the memory is externally owned.  A
descriptor allocation failure THROWs its allocator `ior`.

```forth
0x80000000 2048 8000 16 1 PCM-CREATE-FROM CONSTANT dma-buf
```

### PCM-FREE

```forth
PCM-FREE  ( buf -- )
```

Free the descriptor, and the sample data if owned. Current allocations are
released through the system allocator; the legacy direct-XMEM flag remains
supported. Safe to call on `0` or on a non-owning buffer.

```forth
one-sec-stereo PCM-FREE
```

---

## Accessors

Read-only field access.  Each returns the field value (not address).

```forth
PCM-DATA    ( buf -- addr )      \ pointer to sample data
PCM-LEN     ( buf -- frames )    \ frame count
PCM-RATE    ( buf -- hz )        \ sample rate
PCM-BITS    ( buf -- n )         \ bits per sample (8, 16, 32)
PCM-CHANS   ( buf -- n )        \ channel count
PCM-FLAGS   ( buf -- flags )     \ flag word
PCM-OFFSET  ( buf -- n )        \ cursor position (frame index)
PCM-PEAK    ( buf -- n )        \ stored peak metadata (compatibility name)
PCM-STORED-PEAK ( buf -- n )    \ explicit stored peak metadata accessor
PCM-USER    ( buf -- x )        \ application payload
PCM-FP16?       ( buf -- flag ) \ 16-bit FP16 storage convention
PCM-FP16-MONO?  ( buf -- flag ) \ mono FP16 storage convention
```

The descriptor has no separate sample-encoding field. `PCM-FP16?` therefore
checks the Akashic structural convention (`bits = 16`), not every payload bit;
`PCM-FP16-MONO?` additionally requires one channel. Synthesis and analysis
entry points use these predicates to reject incompatible buffers.

---

## Computed Properties

### PCM-FRAME-BYTES

```forth
PCM-FRAME-BYTES  ( buf -- n )
```

Bytes per frame: `(bits / 8) × channels`.
The multiplication is checked and ABORTs rather than returning a wrapped size.

```forth
\ 16-bit stereo → 4 bytes per frame
\ 8-bit mono    → 1 byte per frame
\ 32-bit 5.1    → 24 bytes per frame
```

### PCM-DATA-BYTES

```forth
PCM-DATA-BYTES  ( buf -- n )
```

Total sample data size in bytes: `frames × frame-bytes`.
The multiplication is checked against the positive cell range.

### PCM-DURATION-MS

```forth
PCM-DURATION-MS  ( buf -- ms )
```

Buffer duration in milliseconds: `frames × 1000 / rate`.

```forth
one-sec-stereo PCM-DURATION-MS .   \ → 1000
```

---

## Sample Access

### PCM-SAMPLE!

```forth
PCM-SAMPLE!  ( value frame chan buf -- )
```

Write one sample at the given frame and channel index.
Automatically dispatches to `C!` (8-bit), `W!` (16-bit), or
`L!` (32-bit) based on the buffer's bit depth.

```forth
\ Write 1000 to frame 0, channel 0
1000 0 0 my-buf PCM-SAMPLE!

\ Write -500 to frame 42, channel 1 (right)
-500 42 1 stereo-buf PCM-SAMPLE!
```

### PCM-SAMPLE@

```forth
PCM-SAMPLE@  ( frame chan buf -- value )
```

Read one sample.  Returns the raw stored value (unsigned for
8-bit, signed for 16/32-bit after sign extension by the caller
if needed).

```forth
0 0 my-buf PCM-SAMPLE@ .   \ read frame 0, channel 0
```

### PCM-FRAME! / PCM-FRAME@

```forth
PCM-FRAME!  ( value frame buf -- )
PCM-FRAME@  ( frame buf -- value )
```

Mono shortcuts — read/write channel 0.  Equivalent to calling
`PCM-SAMPLE!` / `PCM-SAMPLE@` with `chan = 0`.

```forth
440 100 mono-buf PCM-FRAME!
100 mono-buf PCM-FRAME@ .    \ → 440
```

---

## Bulk Operations

### PCM-CLEAR

```forth
PCM-CLEAR  ( buf -- )
```

Zero all sample data (silence).  Uses `0 FILL` across the entire
data area.

### PCM-FILL

```forth
PCM-FILL  ( value buf -- )
```

Write `value` to every sample slot (every channel of every frame).
Dispatches per-sample based on bit depth.

```forth
128 my-8bit-buf PCM-FILL    \ 8-bit center (silence for unsigned)
0 my-16bit-buf PCM-FILL      \ 16-bit silence
```

### PCM-COPY

```forth
PCM-COPY  ( src dst -- )
```

Copy sample data from `src` to `dst`.  Copies
`MIN(src-data-bytes, dst-data-bytes)` bytes via `CMOVE`.
Format compatibility is the caller's responsibility.

```forth
original copy PCM-COPY
```

---

## Buffer Manipulation

### PCM-SLICE

```forth
PCM-SLICE  ( start end buf -- buf' )
```

Create a sub-buffer view into the original data.  The returned
descriptor does **not** own the data — it shares the parent's
sample memory.  Start and end are frame indices, clamped to valid
range.  A negative start clamps to frame 0; an end before the clamped start
produces an empty slice at that start.

Writing through the slice modifies the original buffer's samples.

```forth
100 200 my-buf PCM-SLICE CONSTANT segment
\ segment has 100 frames, pointing into my-buf's data
segment PCM-FREE              \ frees descriptor only
```

### PCM-CLONE

```forth
PCM-CLONE  ( buf -- buf' )
```

Deep copy — allocates a new buffer with identical format and data.
Copies offset, peak, and user fields.  The clone owns its data.

```forth
my-buf PCM-CLONE CONSTANT backup
```

### PCM-REVERSE

```forth
PCM-REVERSE  ( buf -- )
```

Reverse all frames in place.  Multi-channel aware: swaps entire
frames (all channels together), not individual samples.

```forth
my-buf PCM-REVERSE    \ [s0 s1 s2 s3] → [s3 s2 s1 s0]
```

---

## Time Conversion

### PCM-MS>FRAMES

```forth
PCM-MS>FRAMES  ( ms buf -- n )
```

Convert milliseconds to frame count: `ms × rate / 1000`.

```forth
500 my-44k-buf PCM-MS>FRAMES .   \ → 22050
```

### PCM-FRAMES>MS

```forth
PCM-FRAMES>MS  ( n buf -- ms )
```

Convert frame count to milliseconds: `n × 1000 / rate`.

```forth
44100 my-44k-buf PCM-FRAMES>MS .  \ → 1000
```

---

## Resampling & Channel Mixing

### PCM-RESAMPLE

```forth
PCM-RESAMPLE  ( new-rate buf -- buf' )
```

Nearest-neighbor resample to a new sample rate.  Allocates a new
buffer with the target rate, same bit depth and channel count.
New frame count = `src-len × new-rate / src-rate`.

```forth
22050 my-44k-buf PCM-RESAMPLE CONSTANT downsampled
\ Half the sample rate, half the frames
```

### PCM-TO-MONO

```forth
PCM-TO-MONO  ( buf -- buf' )
```

Mix down to mono by averaging all channels per frame.  Allocates
a new single-channel buffer.  If the source is already mono,
returns a clone.

```forth
stereo-buf PCM-TO-MONO CONSTANT mono-mix
```

---

## Analysis & Normalization

The operations in this base module interpret slots as integer PCM. They are
not FP16 amplitude operations even when a synthesis buffer also uses 16-bit
storage. Use `audio/analysis/metrics.f` and `PCM-FP16-PEAK` for synthesized
FP16 audio; use `PCM-STORED-PEAK` to read the metadata field explicitly.

### PCM-SCAN-PEAK

```forth
PCM-SCAN-PEAK  ( buf -- peak )
```

Scan all samples, compute the peak absolute value, store it in the
descriptor's peak field, and return it.  For 8-bit unsigned samples,
values are centered around 128 before computing absolute value.
For 16/32-bit samples, sign extension is applied.

```forth
my-buf PCM-SCAN-PEAK .     \ → 30000
my-buf PCM-STORED-PEAK .    \ → 30000 (also stored)
```

### PCM-NORMALIZE

```forth
PCM-NORMALIZE  ( target buf -- )
```

Scale all samples so the peak equals `target`.  Each sample is
multiplied by `target / current-peak` using integer arithmetic.
No-op if the current peak is 0 (silent buffer).

Internally calls `PCM-SCAN-PEAK` to find the current peak, then
applies per-sample scaling with the appropriate bit-width
read/write operations.

```forth
32767 my-16bit-buf PCM-NORMALIZE   \ maximize 16-bit range
127 my-8bit-buf PCM-NORMALIZE       \ maximize 8-bit range
```
